# Cursora Library Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the `Cursora` library! This library provides a simple way to customize the cursor on your website or web application.

## Getting Started

To get started with Cursora, you'll need to include the library in your project. You can either download the library and include it in your project manually, or you can include it from a CDN. Here's an example of how to include Cursora from a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/cursor-cursora@latest/dist/index.js"></script>
```

Once you've included the library, you can initialize it like this:

```javascript
const cursor = new Cursora();
```

This will create a new instance of the Cursora class and set it as the default cursor on your website.

## How does it look?

You are using the product right now! move the cursor around, hover things and click on elements.
